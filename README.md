# Baltic_Shoreline_Monitor_V1
low-power, solar-powered floating device that uses vision (camera) and acoustic (hydrophone) sensing to detect signs of shoreline pollution, such as surface oil films, unusual noise patterns, or microplastic clusters. The data will be processed using lightweight AI models (TinyML) deployed on an ESP32.
